Air transportation fare prediction Michael Nahum, Arianna Caiffa, Angel Marfiuc

INTRODUCTION:

The purpose of the project is to use these informations to predict flight costs, which can assist both customers and airlines in making informed decisions about booking flights and understanding the factors that affect flight prices.

The dataset includes information such as the airline's name, flight number, source and destination cities, departure and arrival times, number of stops, ticket class, flight duration, days left until departure, and ticket price in local currency.

To begin, we first cleaned the data, handling missing values and outliers. After cleaning the data, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization to evaluate the entire dataset. Then we examined correlations and data distribution, in order to achieve the goal, that is to determine the metric that correlates the most with price.

Next, we selected suitable features and transformed the data as necessary to prepare it for modeling. 
Following that, we divided the data into training and testing sets in order to evaluate at three regression models using appropriate metrics to assess their performance. 
After that, we tuned the hyperparameters of our best-performing model, Ensamble Model, to achieve the best possible performance.
